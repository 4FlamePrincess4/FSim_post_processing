The FSim post-processing R scripts were created to efficiently 1) combine individual fire tifs from FSim runs into a single tif for each fire season, 2) merge outputs from FSim runs split into multiple parts, 3) output fire perimeter and ignition point shapefiles from the sqlite database outputs, and 4) sub-sample seasons to update a landscape with disturbance in FVS or estimate emissions across a range of fire season severities.
